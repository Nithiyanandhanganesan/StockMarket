CPR:
=====
Central Pivot Range (CPR) indicator is used to identify key points of price levels and trade accordingly.

CPR will give forecast on the stock.


You buy when the stock is at BC, with TC as a target and sell (fresh short) when the stock is at the TC with an
expectation that the price declines to BC soon.


FORMULA:
===========
CENTRAL PIVOT (CP) = (HIGH + LOW + CLOSE)/3

TOP CENTRAL PIVOT (TC) = (PIVOT - BOTTOM CENTRAL PIVOT)

BOTTOM CENTRAL PIVOT(BC) = (HIGH + LOW)/2


STANDARD FLOOR PIVOTS:
=======================

R3 = R1 + (HIGH - LOW)
R2 = PIVOT + (HIGH - LOW)
R1 = 2*(PIVOT - LOW)
PIVOT = (HIGH + LOW + CLOSE)/3
S1 = 2*(PIVOT - LOW)
S2 = PIVOT - (HIGH - LOW)
S3 = S1 - (HIGH - LOW)

R=> RESISTANCE
S=> SUPPORT
